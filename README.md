# Spam-Filter
A K Nearest Neighbors classification model to distinguish spam and non spam email.
The classifictaion model is trained on the Spambase dataset from UCI Machine Learning repository.
The databas consists of 60% of non spam and 40% spam emails.
I have compared various classification models like naive bayes,decision tree classifier ,SVM classifier ,Random Forest,bagging Classifier and finally K nearest Neighbors
The Random forest classifier emerged as the best performing model evaluated by K-fold cross validation with an average accuracy of 95.8%
